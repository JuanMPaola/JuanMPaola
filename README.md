# Hi there!👋 my name is Juan Manuel Paola.
<hr>
I'm a developer from Argentina. <br>
I consider myself a curious and proactive developer, deeply motivated by learning and building real solutions. I’ve been creating projects that apply and expand the knowledge gained through my studies as a Computer Systems Analyst and through intensive training in full-stack and backend-focused web development.

Most of my work revolves around Node.js and the TypeScript ecosystem, where I’ve designed and developed REST APIs, microservices, and multi-tenant architectures, while also building polished and user-friendly frontend views.. I also have hands-on experience with C# for backend services and enjoy exploring new technologies whenever a project requires it.

I’m passionate about crafting clean, scalable systems, understanding how things work under the hood, and continuously improving as a software engineer. My goal is to keep growing, experimenting, and contributing to projects that have real impact.
